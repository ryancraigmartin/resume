I'm a 26 year old software engineer from Miami, Florida where I earned a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology from [Florida International University](https://www.cis.fiu.edu/).

<br/>

Most recently, I worked as a Product Developer at [T R I M](https://trimagency.com/team/), a small development agency, focused on building mobile and web applications for clients and first-time founders who are looking to launch their products.

<br/>

Previously, I was part of a large team at building a next-generation Patient and Practice Management / Electronic Health Records platform for medical practices as a Software Engineer at [CareCloud](https://www.carecloud.com/) where I had the opportunity to take on multiple roles as a part of three evolving teams and departments. I was part of the Front-End/UX team working to bring the elegant designs of our talented designers to life in the form of clean, workflow-driven user interfaces to facilitate the Patient-Practitioner experience using React and GraphQL.

<br/>

Prior to my promotion to the Front-End/UX team, I worked on building out Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource compliant Middleware using Google's Golang for a subscription-based micro service architecture built with GraphQL and Express.js. I also became solely responsible for building and managing API integration test suites using Jest, GraphQL, Frisby, and Joi and wrote automated End to End test suites for [CareCloud's Patient Intake Software, Breeze,](https://www.carecloud.com/breeze/) using Selenium, WebdriverIO, Cucumber/Gherkin, Mocha, and Chai.

<br/>

I am fascinated by the technologies that run the services and applications we interface with day to day and continue to stay up to date by teaching myself new technologies and best practices by using online resources including but not limited to [Lynda](https://www.lynda.com/), [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/), [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), [FrontEndMasters](https://frontendmasters.com/), [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/), [Egghead.io](https://egghead.io/) and [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/).

<br/>

I'm also a self-taught sound designer, audio engineer, and disk jockey with a passion for podcasts as a creative digital medium.
