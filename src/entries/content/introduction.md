I'm a 26 year old software engineer from Miami, Florida where I earned a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology from [Florida International University](https://www.cis.fiu.edu/).

<br/>

Most recently, I worked as a Product Developer at [T R I M](https://trimagency.com/team/), a development agency that builds mobile and web applications for first-time founders who are looking to launch their products. During my time at T R I M, I worked as part of a small team that inherited a codebase from a client who's goal was to build out the world's largest MicroNutrition database. I became responsible for building, and maintaining new micro-services, and Slack Bots using [Botkit](https://botkit.ai/) to book meeting rooms, send reminders/confirmation messages, and track package deliveries using the [Nexudus Coworking Management Platform API](https://www.nexudus.com/en/page/demo-landing?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIr_Djy-us6wIVlYpaBR1FlwX0EAAYASAAEgLTX_D_BwE).

<br/>

Previously, I was part of a large team at building a next-generation Patient and Practice Management / Electronic Health Records platform for medical practices as a Software Engineer at [CareCloud](https://www.carecloud.com/). During my time there, I had the opportunity to take on multiple roles as a part of three evolving teams and departments including Front-End/UX, Middleware and Test Automation.

<br/>

I was part of the Front-End/UX team working to bring the elegant designs of our talented designers to life in the form of clean, workflow-driven user interfaces to facilitate the Patient-Practitioner experience using React and GraphQL. Prior to my promotion to the Front-End/UX team, I worked on building out Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource compliant Middleware using Google's Golang for a subscription-based micro service architecture built with GraphQL and Express.js. I also became solely responsible for building and managing API integration test suites using Jest, GraphQL, Frisby, and Joi and wrote automated End to End test suites for [CareCloud's Patient Intake Software, Breeze,](https://www.carecloud.com/breeze/) using Selenium, WebdriverIO, Cucumber/Gherkin, Mocha, and Chai.

<br/>

I am fascinated by the technologies that run the services and applications we interface with day to day and continue to stay up to date by teaching myself new skills and best practices by using online resources including but not limited to [Lynda](https://www.lynda.com/), [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/), [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), [FrontEndMasters](https://frontendmasters.com/), [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/), [Egghead.io](https://egghead.io/) and [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/).

<br/>

I'm also a self-taught sound designer, audio engineer, and disk jockey with a passion for podcasts as a creative digital medium.
